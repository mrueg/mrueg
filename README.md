#### Great to see you here!

My name is Manuel. I'm a long-term contributor to open source projects and currently focussing on and interested in Cloud-Native technology. 
Currently I'm helping out on a couple of projects in this space, among them are [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), [Kube-Router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router), [Prometheus-Community/Helm-Charts](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts) and [CoreDNS/Helm](https://github.com/coredns/helm).

In a prior life, I was also a contributor to [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) and helped out with packaging software there.

In general, I'm always interested in trying out new technologies and improving quality on software that I'm using. A lot of my contributions to other projects therefore are helping out with ensuring quality and security or providing release engineering best practices.

You can reach me via Kubernetes' Slack or Libera Chat. My nick on both services is mrueg.
