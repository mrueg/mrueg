## Great to see you here!

#### About Me

My name is Manuel. I've been contributing to Open Source projects for more than 10 years and am currently focussing on and interested in Cloud-Native technology, in particular Kubernetes. 
Currently I'm helping out on a couple of projects in this space, among them are [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), [Kube-Router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router), [Prometheus-Community/Helm-Charts](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts) and [CoreDNS/Helm](https://github.com/coredns/helm).

From 2012 to 2020 I also was a contributor to [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) and packaged a wide range of software. This allowed me to gain lot of knowledge on building software. Therefore, a lot of my contributions to other projects are helping out with ensuring quality and security or providing release engineering best practices.

You can reach me via Kubernetes' Slack or Libera Chat. My nick on both services is mrueg.
